                            Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age
                            of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV
                            Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording deal with Big Machine Records in 2005 and
                            released her eponymous debut studio album in 2006. She explored country pop on her
                            second and third studio albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010). The success of the
                            former's singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" on both country and pop radio
                            established Swift as a leading crossover artist. She experimented further with pop,
                            rock, and electronic genres on her fourth studio album, Red (2012). Her fifth, the
                            synth-pop album 1989 (2014), effectively transformed her status from country songstress
                            to pop star, supported by the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "Shake It Off",
                            "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". The media scrutiny on her personal life that followed
                            largely inspired Swift's sixth studio album, Reputation (2017), which delved into urban
                            sounds.

                    Parting ways with Big Machine to sign with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released her
                    seventh studio album, Lover, in 2019. After consistent commercial success in the 2010s,
                    she ventured into indie folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums,
                    Folklore and Evermore (2020). Her lyricism on the two albums, inspired by escapism
                    during the COVID-19 pandemic, was commended for its nuanced storytelling. To gain
                    ownership over the masters of her back catalog, Swift released two re-recorded albums in
                    2021, Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), earning acclaim for their
                    enhanced musicality and stronger vocals. Besides music, Swift has starred in various
                    supporting acting roles in films such as Valentine's Day (2010) and Cats (2019). She has
                    released the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020), and the self-directed
                    musical films Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short
                    Film (2021), amongst other specials.
                    <br><br>

                    Having sold over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is one of the best-selling music
                    artists of all time. Her accolades include 11 Grammy Awards (including three Album of
                    the Year wins), an Emmy Award, 12 Country Music Association Awards, 25 Billboard Music
                    Awards (the most wins for a female artist), 32 American Music Awards (the most wins for
                    an artist) and 49 Guinness World Records.
