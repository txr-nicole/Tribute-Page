                Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age
                of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing
                in 2004 and a recording deal with Big Machine Records in 2005 and released her eponymous debut studio
                album in 2006. She explored country pop on her second and third studio albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak
                Now (2010). The success of the former's singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" on both country
                and pop radio established Swift as a leading crossover artist. She experimented further with pop, rock,
                and electronic genres on her fourth studio album, Red (2012). Her fifth, the synth-pop album 1989
                (2014), effectively transformed her status from country songstress to pop star, supported by the
                Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". The media scrutiny
                on her personal life that followed largely inspired Swift's sixth studio album, Reputation (2017), which
                delved into urban sounds.

                Parting ways with Big Machine to sign with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released her
                seventh studio album, Lover, in 2019. After consistent commercial success in the 2010s,
                she ventured into indie folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums,
                Folklore and Evermore (2020). Her lyricism on the two albums, inspired by escapism
                during the COVID-19 pandemic, was commended for its nuanced storytelling. To gain
                ownership over the masters of her back catalog, Swift released two re-recorded albums in
                2021, Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), earning acclaim for their
                enhanced musicality and stronger vocals. Besides music, Swift has starred in various
                supporting acting roles in films such as Valentine's Day (2010) and Cats (2019). She has
                released the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020), and the self-directed
                musical films Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short
                Film (2021), amongst other specials.
                <br><br>
                Having sold over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is one of the best-selling music
                artists of all time. Her accolades include 11 Grammy Awards (including three Album of
                the Year wins), an Emmy Award, 12 Country Music Association Awards, 25 Billboard Music
                Awards (the most wins for a female artist), 32 American Music Awards (the most wins for
                an artist) and 49 Guinness World Records.
